# Intervertebral disc labeling with the hourglass approach

## Description

This is the continuation of the work made by [Reza Azad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reza-azad-37a652109/), [Lucas Rouhier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-rouhier-1aa36a131/?originalSubdomain=ca), and [Julien Cohen-Adad](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=6cAZ028AAAAJ&hl=en) on a deeplearning based architecture called `Stacked Hourglass Network` to detect and classify vertebral discs automatically on MR images.

Their work was [published](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1007/978-3-030-87589-3_42) in a paper called "Stacked Hourglass Network with a Multi-level Attention Mechanism: Where to Look for Intervertebral Disc Labeling" for a MICCAI Workshop in 2021

This repository will be used to train and test the `Stacked Hourglass Network` in different MR case scenario.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
```Bash
git clone https://github.com/spinalcordtoolbox/disc-labeling-hourglass.git
cd disc-labeling-hourglass/
```

2. Set up the required environment and dependencies.
```Bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.8
conda activate myenv
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e
```
(in development) --> cf https://github.com/spinalcordtoolbox/disc-labeling-hourglass/issues/18

3. Gather only vertebral data (from [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) format)
```Bash
python src/dlh/data_management/gather_data.py --datapath DATAPATH -o VERTEBRAL_DATA --suffix-img SUFFIX_IMG --suffix-label SUFFIX_LABEL
```

4. Train hourglass on the vertebral data
> üêù Currently the training is monitored using wandb (please check [here](https://wandb.ai/site)). Please log using `wandb login` in the command or train offline with `wandb offline`
```Bash
python src/dlh/train/main.py --datapath VERTEBRAL_DATA -c t2 --ndiscs 15
```
